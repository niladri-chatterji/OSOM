\subsection{Notation and Definitions}
Given a vector $v$, let $v_i$ denote it's $i^{th}$ component. For a vector we let $\lv v \rv_{p}$ for $p\in [1,\infty]$ denote the $\ell_p$-norm. Given a matrix $M$ we denote it's operator norm by $\lv M \rv_{op}$, and use $\lv M \rv_{F}$ to denote its Frobenius norm. Given a positive definite matrix $V$ we define the matrix norm of $M$ with respect to matrix $V$ as $\lv M \rv_V = \sqrt{M^{\top}V M}$. Given a symmetric matrix $S$ let $\gamma_{\max}(S)$ and $\gamma_{\min}(S)$ denote it's largest and smallest eigenvalues.
